NAME
       %{scl_name}  -  manual page for %{scl_name} %{version} Software Collec‐
       tion

SYNOPSIS
       %{start_command}

DESCRIPTION
       Package %{scl_name} provides Varnish High-performance HTTP accelerator
       as a Software Collection. For  more  information  about  Software
       Collections, see the scl(1) man page. By installing the %{scl_name}
       collection, you will get the minimum working set of packages
       to have a working Varnish HTTP accelerator.

       Software	 Collections  allows use of applications which are not located
       in the filesystem root hierarchy but  are  present  in  an  alternative
       location, which is %{_scl_root} in case of the %{scl_name} collection.

       When  you  want to  work  with the %{scl_name} collection, use the scl
       utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl environ‐
       ment.

EXAMPLES
       scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'

	      Run  a  specific command  with  the argument  --arg within the
	      %{scl_name} software collections environment.

       scl enable %{scl_name} bash

	      Run  an  interactive shell with the %{scl_name} software collec‐
	      tion enabled.

       scl enable %{scl_name} 'man varnishd'

	      Show man pages for the varnishd command, which is  a part  of  the
	      %{scl_name} software collection.
